# FL Studio Plugin Categoriser
A simple WinForms program I made a while ago that replicates the folder structure of VST2 .dll files in FL Studio's plugin database. This is useful if you use multiple DAWs and don't want to have to manually categorise a large collection of VSTs for each DAW.

In order to use it, you must first scan for plugins in FL Studio so that the database (usually in your Documents folder) can be populated. Currently this program only works with a single VST install location (you can only specify one VST folder, so it hasn't been tested with VSTs stored on multiple drives simultaneously).
